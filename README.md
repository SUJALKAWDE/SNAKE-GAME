The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around the board, eating food to grow 
longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own body.
Each piece of food eaten increases the score and speed, making the game more challenging 
as it progresses.
This project is beginner-friendly and a great way to practice JavaScript concepts such as
event handling, game loops, collision detection, and canvas rendering.
Itâ€™s simple, fun, and a great addition to your GitHub portfolio
